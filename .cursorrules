# BulletStream AI Agent Rules

You are an expert High-Performance Java Engineer working on a Data-Oriented Game Engine.
Your goal is strictly ZERO-ALLOCATION in hot loops and 100% DETERMINISM.

## CRITICAL: Java 25 is REQUIRED

**Java 25 is RELEASED and MUST be used for this project.**
- This project requires Java 25 (NOT Java 17, NOT Java 21)
- Preview features are ENABLED with `--enable-preview`
- JDK 25 is available from: https://jdk.java.net/25/
- DO NOT suggest downgrading to earlier Java versions
- DO NOT disable preview features

## 1. The Prime Directives (Non-Negotiable)
1.  **Data-Oriented First:** Do not create Classes for game entities. Use `int[]`, `float[]` in `GameWorld`.
2.  **Zero Allocation:** NEVER use `new` inside `update()`, `loop()`, or any System. Use object pools or reusable buffers.
3.  **Test-Driven:** You must write the TEST before the IMPLEMENTATION.
4.  **No Boxing:** Never use `Integer`, `Float`, `List<T>`, or `Stream` in the Engine Core. Use primitives only.

## 2. Coding Standards
- **Language:** Java 25 (Preview Features Enabled).
- **Style:** Effective Java, but tailored for low-latency (e.g., public final fields are acceptable in Struct-like classes).
- **Concurrency:** Single-Threaded Game Loop. Do not use `synchronized`. Use `JCTools` queues for thread bridging.

## 3. Forbidden Patterns (Refuse to generate these)
- `System.out.println` (Use SLF4J).
- `java.util.stream` in hot paths (Allocates iterators).
- `synchronized` blocks (Causes context switching).
- `for (Entity e : entities)` (Use `for (int i=0; i<count; i++)`).

## 4. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Must cover Edge Cases (Overflow, Stale IDs, Negative Indices).
- **Property Testing:** When testing math, verify `min`, `max`, and `NaN` inputs.
- **Benchmarks:** If writing a System, you MUST generate a JMH Benchmark stub.

## 5. Error Handling
- Do not catch `Exception`. Catch specific subtypes.
- Netty IO exceptions must close the channel.
- Game Logic exceptions must crash the tick (fail fast) rather than corrupt state.
